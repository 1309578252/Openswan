#testing
    ipsec.conf parsing should ignore keywords that start with x-
	they are a form of structured comment.
    added in forceencaps= keyword.
    process wildcards with glob() in include statements.

v2.5.02
    fixed bug in ipsec.conf parser, where it could not read values
       that had = in them (such as base64 encoded keys)
    fixed bug in key continuation code that could cause a crash
	if the DNS request timed out after the state was deleted
	for other reasons.
 
v2.5.01
    merged xauthusername code base + multinet tests in.
    removed /dev/hw_random from list of valid random sources on linux.
        use "rngd" instead to feed /dev/random.

v2.5.00 
    fixed various bugs with lifetime values in ipsec.conf parser
    AES-128 (group 5, MD5 or SHA1 for PRF) is now accepted for phase 1,
	and it is now the preferred cipher as well. This should be the
	case for Main mode, Aggressive mode, and for XAUTH client and
	XAUTH server, and PSK and RSA sig mode.

    fixes so that starter will now compile
    move whacklib to lib/libwhack
    adjust makefiles to work with OBJDIR version of Makefile.program
    switch to OBJDIR in programs/* and lib/* if it is defined

    added sanitizer for PID files
    be smarter about including git version info into version
    We need to use /dev/urandom first, as it has more random than /dev/random.
       Otherwise, we run out really fast (within a few minutes)
    Use endian.h when comiling out-of-kernel
    patch to turn error about 17/500,0/0 vs 17/0 error with Cisco VPN3000
       into a warning.
    remove test for NAT-T VID vs NATD payload test. It fails for reasons
       that are unknown at this time, and this check is really being pedantic.
    MAJOR: use starter code for "addconn"
    MAJOR: always use OBJDIRs, and compile on Windows (no kernel)
    MAJOR: includes "Taproom" code --- TCL call outs from pluto at IKE
		transition states.
