This test case is an IKEv2 responder.  It receives a connection from the
parentI1 test unit test case. The output of parentI1.pcap is copied here to
be processed.
This case should create an R1 packet that can be sent back to the initiator
for test case parentI2.
The sanity.sed in this directory works on the pcap output.
