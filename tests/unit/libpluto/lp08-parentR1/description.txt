This test case is an IKEv2 responder.  It receives a connection from the
parentI1 test unit test case. The output of parentI1.pcap is copied here to
be processed.
This case should create an R1 packet that can be sent back to the initiator
for test case parentI2.

There is a subcase that was debugged in this, which is the case where a bad
KE payload is received, and this results in an invalid-ke-payload. The wrong
KE payload is in fact the case where group2 values were forced rather than
group 14.  This is sub case 1 (output1.txt, R1notify-dump.txt).

Unit case 2 (output2.txt, R1-dump.txt) has the proper inputs.
