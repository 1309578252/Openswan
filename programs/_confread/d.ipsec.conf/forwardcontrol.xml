<para>whether
<emphasis remap='I'>setup</emphasis>
should turn IP forwarding on
(if it's not already on) as IPsec is started,
and turn it off again (if it was off) as IPsec is stopped;
acceptable values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>
and (the default)
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>.
For this to have full effect, forwarding must be
disabled before the hardware interfaces are brought
up (e.g.,
<emphasis remap='B'>net.ipv4.ip_forward&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</emphasis>
in
<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename>),
because IPsec doesn't get control early enough to do that. If this option
is not specified, and subnet-subnet tunnels are configured, then IP
forwarding should be enabled by the system administrator.
